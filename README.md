Tight binding Hamiltonians for 2D materials

# Usage #
The library has functions that return the Bloch Hamiltonian for different 2d-materials. 

# Materials supported #
MoS2

# How the Hamiltonians were obtained #
The tight binding Hamiltonians were obtained by means of the Wannier technique as implemented in Wannier90 over a density functional theory calculation carried out with Quantum Espresso
